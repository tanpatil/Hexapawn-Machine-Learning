# Hexapawn-Machine Learning

Hexapawn is a two-player board game invented by Martin Gardner. It is played on
a 3x3 board with each player given 3 pawn pieces. To win a round a player must
either reach the oposite side of the gameboard or trap their opponents pieces by
preventing them from performing a legal move.



## Running the Program

  * Graphical mode is a modernized version of the game running in a GUI made with Tkinter
  * With either `./hexapawn.py` or `python3 hexapawn.py`
  * Runs usising **python3.1+**. Has no external module dependencies other than Tkinter which is typically bundled with Python 3 in most distributions.
